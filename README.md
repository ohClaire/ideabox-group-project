## Introduction
  Users are welcome to visit IdeaBox to store any ideas that passes their mind. This application allows our users to create a card with a title and description of their idea to be displayed on the page. From here, they can choose to delete a card or favorite it. Favorite cards are saved and remain on the page for users to review as they wish.

  This project was assigned as a part of Turing School of Software and Design's Front-End program, students had one week to complete it.

## Deployed Page

## Features
- When a user loads the page, they will see that it is divided into three sections: 
1. The side bar holds the name of the website and the option for the user to filter their starred ideas using the **Show Starred Ideas** button. 
2. The top purple section holds a form that will accept user inputs for Title and Body. The **Save** button only works after the user has entered text in the input fields. 
3. The bottom white section holds the idea cards. Each card has the Title and Body from the user's respective inputs. From here, the user can choose to **star**, **delete**, or **comment** on the card.
